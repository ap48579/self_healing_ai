"""export_strategy() -- gives a consumer their own copy of the research
harness, in their own repo, so RSI can operate on it in isolation (see
docs/05_rsi_harness2_design_spec.md and the "publishing as a general
package" design discussion).

Correction made while implementing this, worth recording: the original
design assumed only the ~10 RSI-editable "strategy surface" files needed
exporting, with Python's import system "shadowing" them over the library's
bundled copy via sys.path ordering. That doesn't work -- Python doesn't
merge two directories for one package; whichever directory wins on
sys.path must be a complete, self-sufficient `gpt_researcher` package, or
internal imports inside it (agent.py -> actions -> llm_provider -> ...)
break the moment something reaches for a file that wasn't exported. The
fix: export the *entire* vendored tree, not just the editable slice. RSI's
editable surface (what it's actually allowed to propose edits to) stays
exactly the same small list -- this only changes what gets copied to disk,
not what gets edited.

This directory is a full, self-sufficient copy of the vendored GPT
Researcher tree, exported so you can run the self-improvement engine
(`rsi`) against your own git repo instead of sharing one physical copy
with anyone else.

## What you should actually edit

Only these files are the "strategy surface" -- the only things RSI will
ever propose edits to, and the only things worth hand-editing yourself:

```
{file_list}
```

Everything else under `gpt_researcher/` (retrievers, scrapers, the LLM
provider layer, document loaders, ...) is infrastructure. Leave it alone;
it's identical to the pip-installed library's own copy and gets updated by
upgrading the package, not by editing it here.

## Before running RSI against this copy

1. Commit this directory to your own repo's git history. `rsi.run_cycle()`
   needs `repo_root` to be a real git repo with these files already
   committed, or every proposed edit will be rejected with
   "file not found in worktree."
2. **Write your own benchmark** (`benchmark_template.py` has 2-3 example
   tasks marked clearly -- replace them with your own domain's checkable
   ground truth). This is the single most important step: RSI's
   benchmark-gate is only as meaningful as the questions you put in it. A
   generic trivia benchmark tells you nothing about whether an edit helped
   your actual use case.
3. Build a `HarnessSpec` pointing at your own files (see
   `rsi.harness_spec.HarnessSpec` and `rsi.harnesses.RESEARCH_HARNESS` in
   the installed package for the shape to follow) and an `llm_call` (reuse
   `rsi.qwen_ollama_llm_call()` / `rsi.claude_llm_call()`, or write your own
   -- any `async def (system: str, user: str) -> str` works).
4. Put this directory earlier on `sys.path` than the installed package's
   own copy before importing `gpt_researcher`, so your edited files are
   the ones actually used.
