"""Registry of HarnessSpecs this repo's own CLI drives -- the first two
consumers of the generic engine, proving it works for two genuinely
different LLM providers (Claude vs. any Ollama/DashScope model) and two
genuinely different file sets before any third-party consumer touches it.

To add a third: export your own copy of the editable surface into your own
repo (agents.research.scaffold.export_strategy() for the research
harness's shape, or just point at your own files for anything else), write
your own ground-truth benchmark, build your own HarnessSpec and llm_call,
and call rsi.run_cycle(). Nothing in proposer.py, probe.py, or composer.py
needs to change.
